## My Goal

For the past 6 months, I have been studing (and obsessing over) IOS development. I started the bulk of my IOS journey by following a course on Udemy, iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp. While following that course, I created some super fun projects and was able to expand on each of them by creating my own features. Though the app was created with an instructor, I feel it helps represent the skills and tools I now possess as an IOS developer.
